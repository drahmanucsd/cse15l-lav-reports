## Change 1:
This change unsures that if there are any images in the file that those will not be recorded in the final output of list of links:

## Change 2:
This change ensures that the code will break and not include any half open links, such as the one at the bottom of the screenshot where there is an open paren but no closed paren.

## Change 3:
This change ensures that if the square brackets and the parens are too far away from each other, the code will make sure to not include this in its final list of links.
